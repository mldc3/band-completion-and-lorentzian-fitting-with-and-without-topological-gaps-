# band completion and lorentzian fitting with and without topological gaps 
In these experiments, we measure the acoustic response of coupled cylindrical resonators, focusing on how sound propagates through the system and how frequency bands and gaps are formed. The goal is to analyze the resonance spectra obtained from experiments and reconstruct the band structures that describe the behavior of the system, including the presence of possible topological modes. Script 1 – Band detection & SSH fitting  Loads experimental frequency–amplitude data.  Detects spectral peaks with scipy.find_peaks.  Groups peaks into bands/sub-bands and identifies gaps.  Completes missing peaks using thresholds and local searches.  Highlights topological mid-band modes.  Fits results with the SSH dispersion relation (scipy.curve_fit) to compare with theory.  Produces plots of peaks, reconstructed bands, and SSH approximations.  Script 2 – Lorentzian peak fitting & refined band diagrams  Recovers the amplitude–frequency curve by fitting resonances with Lorentzian functions.  Extracts characteristic peak parameters (center, width, Q factor).  Constructs Brillouin zones and band diagrams from filtered peaks.  Interpolates and extrapolates missing modes (via PCHIP interpolation) to complete bands.  Implements error correction and band completion strategies (even/odd missing peaks).  Visualizes experimental vs interpolated/extrapolated data with custom legends.  Generates final refined band structures with improved spectral resolution.  Summary Together, both codes provide a workflow from raw acoustic resonance data → peak detection → Lorentzian fitting → band reconstruction → SSH topological model comparison.
